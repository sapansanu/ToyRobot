#Toy Robot Simulator

☻ The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, of
dimensions 5 units x 5 units.

☻ The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be prevented from falling to destruction. 

There are four buttons to control the robot:

1. MOVE will move the toy robot one unit forward in the direction it is currently facing.

2. LEFT and RIGHT will rotate the robot 90 degrees in the specified direction without changing the position of the robot.

3. REPORT will announce the X,Y and F of the robot. This can be in any form, but standard output is sufficient.
